Description: Confidence intervals for the rate difference (RD) or
    ratio (RR) for independent binomial or Poisson rates, or for odds ratio (OR)
    (binomial only). Includes asymptotic score methods including skewness correction,
    which have been developed from Miettinen & Nurminen and Gart & Nam. Also includes 
    MOVER methods (Method Of Variance Estimates Recovery), similar to the Newcombe
    method but using equal-tailed Jeffreys intervals.
