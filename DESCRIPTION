Description: Computes confidence intervals for the rate (or risk)
    difference ("RD") or ratio ("RR") for independent binomial
    proportions or Poisson rates, or for odds ratio ("OR", binomial
    only). Also confidence intervals for a single binomial or
    Poisson rate. Includes asymptotic score methods including
    skewness corrections, which have been developed from Miettinen
    & Nurminen and Gart & Nam. Also includes MOVER methods
    (Method Of Variance Estimates Recovery), derived from the
    Newcombe method but using equal-tailed Jeffreys intervals.
